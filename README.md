# Phase-1-Project
Single page application to discover art

Imagine you are a recent Flatiron graduate... You nailed the course, learned as much as your brain will allow you, and have even managed to land a high-paying job with one of your favorite tech companies. Things are looking good for you. Everything except your home office. Though you spruced things up a bit with the Christmas tree, its now April 2022 and you need to move on. Will you be working in a boring home office with no color or culture? Heck no! You have always been interested in paintings, though most interactions have only been at a museum. Though you might not have much of an understanding for art, you understand it adds culture and influences creativity. 

Buying art is too expensive, intimidating, and, how will you even find an artist that you actually like? If only there was a website that allows you to rent art from local artists. Oh, look there! Turns out, it exists. This is great (though on a localhost your classmates created)! It is a win-win. You get a rotating gallery of home-grown art, at a fraction of its actual value, all-the-while supporting your local art community. The artist now has recurring revenue, and a ledger of monthly transactions they can now use to value their pieces.
